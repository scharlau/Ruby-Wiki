# RUBY WIKI README

This is a simple wiki to illustrate various design patterns in Ruby.

### Base app 
This is a single page wiki with everything, apart from the file to store info being in the one ruby file. Look at it and see it in all of its messiness.

### Composite app
This version has made the code more readable by moving sections to erb files for inclusion in the main file at run time.
